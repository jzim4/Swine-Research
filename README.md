# Swine-Research

For this research project, I was an intern at the Swine Teaching and Research Center through the University of Pennsylvania. I created graphs in R that demonstrated swine movement throughout the day using datapoints including lying bouts, motion index, time spent standing, and steps. My work was then used to determine how to minimize swine movement to ensure the safety of newborn piglets.
